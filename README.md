# esp8266-aws-switch

An ESP8266-based switch for my [AWS IoT light](http://mjoldfield.com/atelier/2017/05/yauiotl.html),
built around Mongoose OS.

You can read more about it on [my
website](http://mjoldfield.com/atelier/2017/07/esp8266-switch.html).

## Repo layout

* case : PDFs for the case

* fs : Files for the ESP8266: for now just a new init.js.

## Caveats

This is more a brain dump than proper instructions. Itâ€™s probably worth contacting
me before using any of this.
